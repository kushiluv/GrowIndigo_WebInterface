Developed a web application for visualizing geofence fields. Performed data cleaning on the given dataset and utilized Leaflet for displaying the fields. Implemented Flask for the backend, vanilla js and CSS for the frontend, and integrated OAEM authentication using Microsoft Azure to validate the login.

The web application takes the data from a CSV/excel file and allows the user to make changes to the polygon on the map with the help of several filters and an easy-to-understand editing interface and then these changes are saved back to the original file.
